Side Bar
Location: To the right of the Activity Bar.
Purpose: Displays context-specific views based on the selected icon in the Activity Bar. For example, when the Explorer view is selected, the Side Bar shows the file and folder structure of the current workspace. It also includes views for search results, source control repositories, debug information, and installed extensions.

Editor Group
Location: Center of the window.
Purpose: Main area where files are opened and edited. Users can open multiple files in tabs within an Editor Group and can split the editor into multiple groups to view and edit files side by side. This area supports various programming languages, offering syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and other code editing features.

Status Bar
Location: At the bottom of the window.
Purpose: Provides information about the current state of the workspace and the active file.
